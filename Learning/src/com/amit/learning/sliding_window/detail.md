The Sliding Window pattern is a powerful technique for solving problems involving arrays or strings, especially when dealing with contiguous elements. It's highly efficient for optimizing brute-force approaches that would otherwise require nested loops.

What Is the Sliding Window Pattern?
It involves creating a window (a subrange) over some part of the data structure and sliding it over to inspect different portions while maintaining a certain condition.

The window can be of fixed size (e.g., sum of k elements).

Or it can be dynamic, growing and shrinking as needed (e.g., longest substring with at most k distinct characters).

ðŸ›  When to Use Sliding Window
Use it when you're asked to:

Find subarrays or substrings with a certain sum or condition

Compute max/min/average over a window

Identify longest/shortest contiguous subarrays with a constraint

Common Sliding Window Problems
Here are some examples:

Fixed-size window

Problem: Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k

Technique: Add new element as the window slides, subtract the element thatâ€™s left behind.

Dynamic-size window

Problem: Longest substring with at most k distinct characters

Technique: Expand the window until invalid, then shrink from the left until valid again.
